## Perplexity Powered Assistant Guide

### Which Model
Perplexity Pro uses their own model by default, but specific models can be chosen in user settings. The model i used is the free version Perplexity AI.

We also explored Deepseek R-1 and OpenAI's o3-mini in the spanish sentence constructor video.

### Prompting Guides

It appears that Perplexity does not have any special prompting requirements (XML, markdown) to best understand context like other models.

## **Prompt Observation**
The model performed as expected, it was brief and straight to the point. it gave a sentence in english and asked me to translate it to spanish.

It also gave the vocubulary table for the sentence it wanted me to translate to spanish, sentence structure and only two clues and considerations as instructed.


### Answer  

Here is your sentence to translate into Spanish:
"The professor is explaining the complex theory to the students."

| Spanish  | English   |
|----------|----------|
| profesor | professor |
| explicar | to explain |
| teoría   | theory    |
| estudiante | student  |

#### **Sentence Structure**
[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Preposition] [Object].

#### **Clues and Considerations**
- Consider the verb tense that fits the context of the sentence.
- Think about how to express "to the students" in Spanish, considering prepositions and word order.

I got the translation of the above from chagpt which is **"El profesor está explicando la teoría compleja a los estudiantes"**, below is the result it gave me:




### Answer  
Your translation, *"El profesor está explicando la teoría compleja a los estudiantes,"* is mostly correct. However, the original sentence is *"The professor is explaining the complex theory to the students."* In Spanish, the definite article *"the"* is translated as *"la"* for feminine nouns like *"teoría,"* but the word order and adjective placement are slightly different. The correct translation should be *"El profesor está explicando la teoría compleja a los estudiantes,"* which you provided.  

However, if you want to emphasize that it is a specific theory, you might consider using *"la teoría compleja"* as you did. The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning.  

It then asked me to translate another sentence as instructed in the prompt when i get the correct spanish translation.
