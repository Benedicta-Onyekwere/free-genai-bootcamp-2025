## ChatGPT Powered Assitant Guide

### Which Model

ChatGPT-4 (specifically GPT-4-turbo)

> I have the free version of ChatGPT.  GPT-4 is fast enough, I don't want to use the o1 reasoning models because they have limit use per day.

## Prompting Guides

Just like Meta AI there are no specific formatting to best provide context.



## Initial Prompt Observation

The model seems to perform as expected. The model is aware of its initial state. The model produces a chart, clues, considerations, and suggestions. The model keeps putting location at the end and not the beginning as the prompt gave it example of what to do and it repeated the Romaji word, "miiru" to mean the samething as "to see" and "to look at". the result of the prompt is shown below:

#### **Vocabulary Table**  

| Japanese  | Romaji   | English                      |  
|-----------|---------|-----------------------------|  
| 烏（からす）  | karasu   | raven                        |  
| 今朝（けさ）  | kesa     | this morning                 |  
| 庭（にわ）   | niwa     | garden                       |  
| 見る（みる）  | miru     | to see (transitive verb)     |  
| 見る（みる）  | miru     | to look at (transitive verb) |  

#### **Sentence Structure**
1st Clause: [Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]?

2nd Clause: [Subject] [Verb] [Location]

#### **Clues and Considerations**
- The first sentence is a past tense question about seeing something in the morning.

- The second sentence is describing the subject’s action in relation to a place.

- "This morning" functions as a time phrase and typically comes at the beginning of the sentence.

- The verb "to see" is a transitive verb, so it needs an object marker.

- "They" refers to a previously mentioned subject, so it doesn’t need to be explicitly stated in Japanese.

- "Looking at" uses the same verb as "to see" in Japanese.
The garden is a location, so it requires a location marker.
 

 ## Secondary Prompt Observation
 After the teaching instructions, vocabulary table, sentence strucure were all re-adjusted to include more instructions in order to streamline the language and not make it more verbose, the model performed as expected and incorporated these changes and gave a more elaborate response as shown below;

 #### **Vocabulary Table**   

| Japanese | Romaji | English |  
|----------|--------|---------|  
| 今朝 | kesa | this morning |  
| あなた | anata | you |  
| 見る | miru | to see |  
| カラス | karasu | raven |  
| 彼ら | karera | they |  
| 見る | miru | to look |  
| 私たち | watashitachi | we/our |  
| 庭 | niwa | garden |  


#### **Sentence Structure**
[Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?

[Subject] [Verb] [Location].

#### **Clues and Considerations**
- The first sentence is a question asking if "you" saw something. Think about how to form a question in Japanese.

- The second sentence describes an action in the past, indicating "they" were looking at something.
Japanese often omits the subject if it's clear from context.

- "This morning" should go at the beginning of the sentence.

- The verb "to see" should be in the past tense for the question.

- "They" in Japanese can be omitted, but if included, use the correct pronoun.

- "Looking at" requires a verb form that indicates an ongoing action in the past.
