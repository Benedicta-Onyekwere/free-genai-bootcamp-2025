## Setup and Prerequisites

### Ruby Installation and Version Management
1. Installed required GPG keys for RVM:
   ```bash
   gpg2 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
   ```

2. Installed RVM (Ruby Version Manager):
   ```bash
   \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
   source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
   ```

3. Initially attempted Ruby 3.4.1, but encountered system compatibility issues:
   ```bash
   rvm install 3.4.1  # Failed due to system compatibility
   ```

4. Successfully installed Ruby 3.3.0 as a compatible alternative:
   ```bash
   rvm install 3.3.0
   rvm use 3.3.0 --default
   ```

5. Installed Bundler for dependency management:
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```

### Ruby RSpec Setup
1. Created a new Ruby test directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p test/ruby/spec
   cd test/ruby
   ```

2. Initialized Ruby project and installed dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle init
   ```

3. Added required gems to Gemfile:
   ```ruby
   source "https://rubygems.org"
   gem "httparty"
   gem "rspec"
   gem "json"
   ```

4. Installed dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

## Testing Process

### 1. Initial API Testing
- Created base RSpec test structure
- Implemented test cases for all major endpoints
- Verified response formats and status codes

### 2. Endpoint Implementation Testing

#### Words API
- Tested pagination functionality
  ```bash
  # Example API call
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/words?page=1
  
  # Example Response
  {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "japanese": "こんにちは",
        "romaji": "konnichiwa",
        "english": "hello",
        "correct_count": 5,
        "wrong_count": 1
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "current_page": 1,
      "total_pages": 10,

      "items_per_page": 10
    }
  }
  ```
- Verified word retrieval with statistics

  ```bash
  # Example API call
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/groups/1/words
  
  # Example Response
  {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Basic Greetings",
        "word_count": 25
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "current_page": 1,
      "total_pages": 5,
      "total_items": 25,
      "items_per_page": 10
    }
  }
  ```
- Tested group details retrieval
- Verified word associations within groups
- Tested study session listings per group

#### Study Activities API
- Implemented creation of study activities
  ```bash
  # Example API call
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/study_activities \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "name": "Vocabulary Practice",
      "description": "Practice Japanese vocabulary with flashcards",
      "thumbnail_url": "https://example.com/vocab.jpg"
    }'
  
  # Example Response
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Vocabulary Practice",
    "description": "Practice Japanese vocabulary with flashcards",
    "thumbnail_url": "https://example.com/vocab.jpg",
    "created_at": "2024-03-14T11:28:30Z"
  }
  ```
- Tested activity retrieval and listing
- Verified proper error handling and validation

#### Study Sessions API
- Created comprehensive session workflow tests
  ```bash
  # Example API call to create session
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/study_sessions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "group_id": 1,
      "study_activity_id": 1
    }'
  
  # Example Response
  {
    "id": 1,
    "group_id": 1,
    "study_activity_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2024-03-14T11:30:00Z"
  }
  
  # Example word review submission
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/study_sessions/1/words/1/review \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "correct": true
    }'
  ```
- Implemented word review functionality
- Verified session statistics and progress tracking

#### Dashboard API
- Tested last session retrieval
  ```bash
  # Example API call
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/quick-stats
  
  # Example Response
  {
    "success_rate": 85.5,
    "total_study_sessions": 10,
    "total_active_groups": 3,
    "study_streak_days": 5
  }
  ```
- Verified study progress calculations
- Confirmed quick stats functionality

### 3. RSpec Test Implementation
We created comprehensive RSpec tests for each endpoint:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'Language Portal API' do
  let(:base_url) { 'http://localhost:3000/api' }

  describe 'Study Activities API' do
    it 'creates a new study activity' do
      payload = {
        name: 'Vocabulary Practice',
        description: 'Practice Japanese vocabulary with flashcards',
        thumbnail_url: 'https://example.com/vocab.jpg'
      }

      response = HTTParty.post(
        "#{base_url}/study_activities",
        body: payload.to_json,
        headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' }
      )

      expect(response.code).to eq(201)
      expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).to include(
        'name' => payload[:name],
        'description' => payload[:description]
      )
    end
  end
end
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Port Configuration Issues
**Challenge**: Initially encountered port binding conflicts when trying to run the server. Previous attempts to use ports 8080 and 8000 resulted in "address already in use" errors.

**Solution**:
- Systematically tested different port configurations
- Identified and terminated conflicting processes using those ports
- Finally settled on port 3000 which was available and stable
- Added port configuration to environment variables for flexibility
- Documented port usage in project setup instructions

### 2. Study Activity Creation Issue
**Challenge**: Initially encountered "Method not implemented" error when creating study activities.

**Solution**:
- Updated handler implementation to properly initialize service
- Added proper error logging
- Implemented nil checks for service initialization
- Added comprehensive error handling

### 3. Service Layer Integration
**Challenge**: Service layer wasn't properly integrated with handlers.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper dependency injection
- Added service validation in handlers
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- Improved error message clarity

### 4. Database Connection Issues
**Challenge**: Intermittent database connection errors during testing.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper connection pooling
- Added connection validation checks
- Enhanced error handling for database operations
- Improved transaction management
